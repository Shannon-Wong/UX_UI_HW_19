      <th>My name is Shannon Wong, and I transitioned my career from being an Apparel Product Developer to a professional UX/UI Designer within the New York City Area. 
      Recently I completed an intensive UX/UI Bootcamp at Columbia University. I’m passionate about improving the lives of other by creating user centric & accessible experiences & designs.
      In my professional & personal life I celebrate every win, no matter how small. As a designer your designs are continuously being improved. Each piece of the design amongst a team make those design seamless. 
      In my spare time, you can find me cycling or running around the city.
      If you are interested in collaborating or connecting, I can be reached via
      Email or  Linkedin.</th>
